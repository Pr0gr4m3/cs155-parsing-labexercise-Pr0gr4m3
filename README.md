## How to Compile

## PROGRAM ABORTS PARSING AFTER ENCOUNTERING A SYNTAX ERROR SO SOMETHING LIKE ./parsing < error.txt WON'T WORK

### Using Makefile

```bash
make
./parsing
```


### Alternatively

```bash
bison -d bison.y
flex flex.l
gcc bison.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl -o parsing
./parsing
```

### AFTER TYPING ./parsing , YOU CAN TYPE AN EXPRESSION AND THEN PRESS ENTER TO IDENTIFY WHETHER IT HAS SYNTAX ERRORS OR NOT
### BASED ON THE GIVEN CFGS IN THE PDF FILE: THE EXPRESSIONS ARE PLUS, MINUS, TIMES, AND PARENTHESES. THE OPERANDS ARE EITHER AN INTEGER OR A SINGLE LETTER LOWER CASE VARIABLE
